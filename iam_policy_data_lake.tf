# DataLakeBucketAccessPolicy — custom policy enforcing two compliance rules:
#   1. Access is scoped to data-lake-* buckets only (not all S3).
#   2. Uploads without AES256 server-side encryption are explicitly DENIED.
#      DENY statements override Allow in any other policy — this is the
#      enforcement mechanism for "all customer data must be encrypted".
